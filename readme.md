## Description

A cost-effective parking solution to address the problems faced by patients/attendants. he solution that we are looking is from a space optimization angle. There is a parking area with limited space. Once a vehicle enters, the system should be able to calculate its space requirement for parking and put it in a
location to get optimal usage.
